# Getting On Board

There are several things you will need to do to get on board and prepared to work in the lab.  

- **Complete a registration form** (PSY 390/391/498 only). Enroll in the section of the course that lists Dr. Karpicke as the instructor. After you have requested enrollment in the course, your registration will need to be approved by Dr. Karpicke and your academic advisor. Make sure to register before the deadline for adding a course. View the deadlines [here](https://www.purdue.edu/registrar/calendars/){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.
- **Complete CITI training.** You will need to complete the curriculum for the learner group "Social Behavioral Research for Investigators and Key Personnel" and "Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training – Basic Course – For Undergraduate Students". Please follow these [instructions](https://www.irb.purdue.edu/docs/CITI%20Registration%20Instruction%20Sheet%20Revised%201.29.19.docx){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} to register and begin training. Once you have completed the training, save the completion report into a PDF file named “Last Name_First Name_CourseName” (use your name and the name of the completed course. That is, either "KeyPersonnel" or "RCR"). Finally, send the PDF to the Lab Manager. This must be completed before you can begin working with subjects or their data.
- **Get a Sona account.** Once you have completed CITI training, the Lab Manager will request a Sona account for you. You will be emailed login information. Make sure to change the temporary password to a password that you will remember.
- **Get added to Slack.** Have someone in the lab add you to the relevant Slack channels.
- **Get added to Google calendars.** Give the email address connected to your Google Calendar to the Lab Manager so that they can add you to the Google calendars.
- **Get added to Box.** Set up your [Box account](https://purdue.box.com){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"} your career account and Purdue login credentials. Then ask the Lab Manager to share the lab's Box folder(s) with you.
- **Complete Lab Orientation.**
- **Read the Introduction, Lab Policies, and Running Lab Experiments sections of the Lab Handbook.** Keep reading!
