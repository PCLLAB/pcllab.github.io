# Starting a New Sona Experiment

This page contains information about how to create a new experiment on Sona. If you have an existing Sona experiment/number that uses the same consent/debrief forms and other details, you can reuse it rather than creating a new experiment on Sona. 

Detailed instructions can also be found on the [PSY 120 Sona pool procedures page](https://www.purdue.edu/hhs/psy/research/procedures/protocol_preparation.html#sonainst){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.


## Set up the Experiment on Sona

- Log in to Sona: <https://purdue-psych.sona-systems.com/>{target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
- Click "Create a new study" under "Add New Study"
- Select the type of study (e.g., standard single session)
- Under "Basic Study Information" fill out the relevant details. The title of the experiment must match the name of the [IRB protocol](lab-irb-information.md) (e.g., "Memory and Metacognition"), so make sure to add a number as a unique identifier.
- You must add "Learning Lab" as a user in each experiment in Sona. Either now, or after the experiment is created you will also need to add the 390 students that will be running the experiment as users.
- Make the location for your experiment the PRCE 171 Waiting Room and instruct students to wait in that room for the experimenter.

## Prepare paperwork for the Sona Coordinator (currently: Jill Gulker)

You need to prepare the following items:

- A copy of the study description you will use on Sona.
- A copy of the informed consent document that includes the IRB approved protocol number and the SONA study number(s) and title.
- A copy of the debriefing form for your study that includes the SONA study number(s) and title.
- A copy of the approved [IRB protocol](lab-irb-information.md) for your study.

Templates of consent forms, debriefing forms, and Sona descriptions can be found on the LearningLab share in the folder Lab IRB Documents.

## Final Steps

- Make sure all information, including IRB numbers and Sona numbers, is correct on all forms.
- Email the Sona the documents listed above to Jill Gulker (<jgulker@purdue.edu>)
- Once the experiment is approved by Jill you will be able to post sessions on Sona.
- At this point, you are now ready to run subjects.
