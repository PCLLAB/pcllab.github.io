# Lab IRB Information

## Links

The Purdue IRB website is here: <https://www.irb.purdue.edu/>{target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer"}

## Importance of the IRB

Every year, I am required to submit a count of the number of subjects tested during the year for all of our IRB protocols. As the Principal Investigator, I am required by the IRB to affirm the following things:

- All signed consent forms are readily accessible to the PI
- All signed consent forms will be accessible to the PI for 3 years following the closure of the IRB protocol
- All personnel involved with the research have current CITI certification in human subjects research

## Current IRB Protocols

## Where to Find Lab IRB documents

Lab IRB documents are stored on Box. Go to Learning Lab and find the folder called IRB. There you will find folders for each IRB protocol. Within each IRB protocol folder, there are subfolders for:

- **Approval Documents.** These are for reference only.
- **Templates:** This folder includes templates of consent forms and debriefing forms that you will need to tailor for your experiment.
- **Scanned Consent Forms.** This folder is where you will [archive your scanned consent forms](../scanning.md).
